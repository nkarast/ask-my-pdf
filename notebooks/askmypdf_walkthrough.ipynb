    "AskMyPDF is a simple RAG project that uses a *local* LLM to embed and generate responses to a user question using as context the PDF document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is built around \n",
    "- `langchain` runnables\n",
    "- `llama_cpp_python` which allows the use of GGUF models over a C++ compiled executor\n",
    "- `ChromaDB` as a vector store for the embeddings\n",
    "- `streamlit` to develop the basic UI and run it in a local server.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this notebook to be useful, make sure you have the following dependencies:\n",
    "- `langchain` both `core` and `community`\n",
    "- `llama-cpp-python`\n",
    "- `chromadb`\n",
    "- `pypdf`\n",
    "- `gradio`: the last cell on the notebook uses a `Gradio` interface for a quick in-notebook experimentation instead of a `streamlit` implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B. #1:** In this notebook we are using the `Llama-2-7b-chat` model quantized and provided by [`TheBloke`](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF) to both embed the document and generate the response. In terms of the `llama-cpp-python` dependecy, it looks like the latest version does not support generation of embeddings using models with no pool layers, throwing a segfault. A quick solution is to downgrade to `llama-cpp-python==0.2.47`\n",

On-momentum particles up to 3 σare being tracked for one\\nsynchrotron period under space charge in PyORBIT [21]. The space charge is included in\\nthe simulation by the frozen solver, i.e. Bassetti Erskine formula. The tunes of the particles\\nare calculated from the turn by turn data using PyNAFF [22] and are also plotted in Fig. 4.\\nThe comparison of the analytical evaluation using PySCRDT and the simulation data is in\\ngood agreement with the PySCRDT. Note that in the analytical evaluation only the space\\ncharge potential is taken into account while in the simulations extra detuning from the lattice\\nnon-linear elements can be seen. This is the reason for the minor diﬀerences between the\\nanalytical estimations and the simulations. Including higher potential orders the detuning\\nof even higher amplitude particles could be evaluated.\\n5 Conclusions\\nThe module PySCRDT is able to calculate the RDTs coming from the space charge potential\\nof Gaussian distributions. Agreement between the code predictions for resonance excitation\\nwith simulations and measurements has been demonstrated. The non-linear detuning coming\\nfrom the space charge potential is also evaluated in the presented code and can provide the\\nexpected space charge tune spread depending on the order of the potential used.\\n9', metadata={'page': 8, 'source': '/Users/nkarast/Documents/repos/github/ask-my-pdf/asset/CERN-ACC-NOTE-2019-0046.pdf'}),\n",

In this form, noted as ¯Vsc, it can be included in the Hamiltonian\\nof Eq.

In\\nthis description the dependency on the transverse position and thus the potential is of order\\n(h+i) inxand (j+k) iny. The dependency on the tunes is ( h−i) in Q xand (j−k)\\nin Q y, while ‘l’ indicates the harmonic of the resonance. Therefore the resonance condition\\nis: (h−i)Qx+ (j−k)Qy=l. In the simplest case, where i=k= 0, the resonance can be\\ndescribed using only 3 indices {m,n,l}where the dependency on both position and tune is\\nof order{m}inxand{n}inyand the resonance condition becomes: mQx+nQy=l.\\nApplying the Floquet transformation of Eq.
